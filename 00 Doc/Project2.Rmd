Project 2 required Jeffrey and I to import a large data set onto Oracle Server and call the data into RStudio to analyze. 

Dataset: Jcn565-311Calls

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
